# ABUY

ABUY is (will be) satirical management sim game/website inspired by old school Ebay.

**Can you buy, auction and sell your way to profit?**

## Tech Stack

This project uses:
- Typescript
- NextJS
- Tailwind
- PostgreSQL
- Mantine component library
- Tabler icons
- Stock images from places like Pexels, Unsplash, Pixabay, Shopify
## Goals

- A detailed shopping site simulation that allows you to buy virtual items with virtual money, and resell them on a virtual market.
- Game-y randomness like market trends, item sales, new product releases, etc.
- Rewards like acheivement badges and exclusive deals for success.

## Status

- Project should be functional in a basic state in not too long, mainly the first goal met. Some simulation aspects I've found will probably be out of scope for a project like this, time based simulation for example would be much easier to write and manage in a dedicated piece of software written in something like C# vs a NextJS site. The goal was something presentable as a site, and to practice with React/NextJS, but I'd like to flesh it out more fully at some point beyond the basics. For now, I'm planning to get it basically working and bug free before taking a break to work on other projects.
