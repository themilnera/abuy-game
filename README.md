# ABUY

ABUY is (will be) satirical management sim game/website inspired by old school Ebay.

**Can you buy, auction and sell your way to profit?**

## Tech Stack

This project uses:
- Typescript
- NextJS
- Tailwind
- PostgreSQL
- Mantine component library
- Tabler icons
- Stock images from places like Pexels, Unsplash, Pixabay, Shopify
## Goals

- A detailed shopping site simulation that allows you to buy virtual items with virtual money, and resell them on a virtual market.
- Game-y randomness like market trends, item sales, new product releases, etc.
- Rewards like acheivement badges and exclusive deals for success.

## Status

- The project is basically functional. I sort of abandonded the effort to make this a fully fledged game, not because it's not a good idea, but because I found it pretty tedious to try and do as a website. I never intended this to be a multi-player experience, so I realized I was creating a lot of extra work by making it a site vs just creating it in C# or in a game engine. Every little thing requires API routes and back and forth from the database, then data parsing since I was trying to be efficient and not create separate tables for everything, and all of that must be done within the state-management system of React (NextJS). In other words, I'm deciding this project is as complete as it's going to get. I may at some point create an actual game like this, but if I do so, it'll probably be in a game engine. This began to grow very frustrating to manage by the end. The real goal was to practice with NextJS and Typescript, though, and I am satisfied that it. I'd like to make another site with NextJS in the near future, probably something more focused and single purpose oriented.
